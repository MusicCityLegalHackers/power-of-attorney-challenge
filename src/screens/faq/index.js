      </Heading>

        What is this form used for?
      </Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        This form was created for immigrant parents in Tennessee who face the threat of being detained and/or deported. It allows parents to grant a caregiver temporary rights to make decisions for their minor child on their behalf. The Power of Attorney goes into effect only if the parents have been detained or deported. Completion of this form, along with the proper signatures, authorizes the caregiver to enroll the child in school, obtain medical treatment for the child, and provide for the childâ€™s food, housing, and travel.
